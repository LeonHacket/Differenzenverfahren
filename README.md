# Numerical Solution of Boundary Value Problems  

## Overview  
This project applies numerical methods to solve **second-order boundary value problems (BVPs)** using the **finite difference method** in Python.  
It demonstrates how to handle both **linear** and **nonlinear** problems, and how to improve accuracy with **Richardson extrapolation**.  

ðŸ“„ A detailed report with results, error analysis, and convergence plots can be found in [Resultate.pdf](Resultate.pdf).

## Key Skills Highlighted  
- **Numerical Analysis:** Finite differences, Newtonâ€™s method, error analysis, convergence studies.  
- **Scientific Programming in Python:** Implemented algorithms for solving linear and nonlinear systems, structured code design.  
- **Optimization of Accuracy:** Applied Richardson extrapolation to systematically improve numerical solutions.  
- **Data Presentation:** Analyzed results with tables and plots, and documented findings clearly.

## Methods Implemented  
- **Finite Difference Method (FDM):** Discretized derivatives on a uniform grid.  
- **Linear Solver:** Used the Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal systems.  
- **Nonlinear Solver:** Applied Newtonâ€™s method with a tridiagonal Jacobian.  
- **Richardson Extrapolation:** Improved solution accuracy beyond the base scheme.

## Results  
- Verified **second-order convergence** for linear problems.  
- Achieved **machine-precision accuracy** after Richardson extrapolation.  
- Newtonâ€™s method converged rapidly (â‰ˆ4 iterations) for nonlinear cases.  
- Investigated a challenging problem with singularities near \(x=0\), showing the limitations of uniform grids and pointing to adaptive strategies.
